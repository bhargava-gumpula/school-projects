	<p style="margin-top: 300; margin-left: 350;">The typical weather in Greece varies depending on the region and time of year. Greece generally experiences a <br>Mediterranean climate, which is characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers.
<br><br><br>
In the summer months (June to August), temperatures in Greece can range from 30°C to 40°C (86°F to 104°F) or<br> even higher, especially in the interior and on the southern islands. The coastal areas are usually a bit cooler due to<br> sea breezes. This is also the driest period, with very little rainfall.
<br><br><br>
In the winter months (December to February), temperatures are milder, ranging from 10°C to 20°C (50°F to 68°F) <br>depending on the region. The northern parts of the country and the mountainous areas tend to be cooler, and can <br>even experience snowfall. The southern regions and islands are generally warmer and receive more rainfall during <br>this time.
<br><br><br>
Spring (March to May) and fall (September to November) are considered the best times to visit Greece. The weather <br>is generally mild and pleasant, with temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F), and there is less tourism <br>during these periods, making it easier to explore the country's many historic sites and natural beauty spots.</p>
